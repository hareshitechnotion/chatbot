both
 
professionally
 
rewarding
 
and
 
personally
 
fulfilling.
 
To  help  you  acclimate  to  our  organization  and  culture,  we’ve  provided  some  essential  
information.
 
The
 
Human
 
Resources

outlines
 
the

of
 
your
 
association,
 
along
 
with
 
rules
 
and
 
procedures
 
to
 
support
 
your
 
daily
 
work.
 
Integrity  is  fundamental  in  all  our  interactions,  both  internally  and  externally.  
Maintaining
 
our
 
company’s
 
reputation
 
and
 
the
 
trust
 
of
 
our
 
stakeholders

crucial,
 
and

declare
 
that
 
we
 
would
 
be

HANDBOOK  INTERPRETATIONS  
In  the  event  of  disputes  arising  from  broader  interpretations  of  any  subject  in  this  
handbook,
 
the
 
decision
 
of
 
Management
 
will
 
be
 
considered
 
final.
 
All  associates,  consultants,  and  interns  are  encouraged  to  read,  understand,  and  
comply
 
with
 
the
 
provisions
 
outlined
 
in
 
this
 
manual.
 
 POLICY  STATEMENT  
At  iTechNotion,  our  human  resources  are  our  most  valuable  assets.  Management  
is
 
committed
 
to
 
providing
 
a
 
professional,
 
motivating,
 
fair,
 
and
 
equitable
 
working
 
environment
 
based
 
on
 
sound
 
business
 
principles.
 
Our
 
policies
 
aim
 
to
 
foster
 
a
 
challenging,
 
stimulating,
 
and
 
enjoyable
 
atmosphere
 
that
 
encourages
 
everyone
 
to
 
perform
 
at
 
their
 
best.
  During  the  course  of  business,  it  may  be  necessary  to  add,  delete  or  make  changes  
to
 
the
 
policy
 
because
 
of
 
factors
 
that
 
affect
 
our
 
industry
 
or
 
the
 
general
 
social
 
and
 
economic
 
conditions
 
prevailing
 
at
 
any
 
point
 
of
 
time.
 
When
 
and
 
if
 
it
 
does
 
become
 
necessary
 
to
 
make
 
changes
 
all
 
associates,
 
consultants,
 
interns
 
and
 
associates
 
will
 
be
 
notified.
 

    
CONDITIONS  OF  EMPLOYMENT   NEW  EMPLOYEE  INTRODUCTION/ORIENTATION  
On  the  day  of  your  appointment,  you  will  receive  a  Welcome  Kit  containing  important  
information
 
and
 
materials.
 
The  Department  Head  or  designated  personnel  will  conduct  an  orientation  program  
for
 
new
 
recruits.
 
This
 
session
 
aims
 
to
 
provide
 
essential
 
information
 
about
 
the
 
department
 
and
 
clarify
 
your
 
job
 
profile
 
as
 
outlined
 
in
 
your
 
job
 
description.
 
This
 
orientation
 
is
 
an
 
important
 
step
 
in
 
helping
 
you
 
acclimate
 
to
 
your
 
role
 
and
 
our
 
organizational
 
culture.
 
 WORK  HOURS  &  WORKDAYS  
Regular  office  hours  are  from  9:30  AM  to  6:30  PM ,  Monday  to  Friday,  which  includes  a  
45-minute
 
lunch
 
break
 
and
 
a
 
15-minute
 
tea
 
break
.
 
All
 
associates
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
work
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
40
 
hours
 
per
 
week
 
(not
 
including
 
lunch
 
and
 
other
 
breaks,
 
such
 
as
 
tea
 
breaks).
 
In  departments  where  workflow  demands  flexibility,  work  hours  may  vary.  Associates  
may
 
also
 
be
 
required
 
to
 
work
 
additional
 
hours
 
as
 
needed
 
to
 
meet
 
project
 
requirements.
 
As  a  general  policy,  Management  does  not  encourage  associates  to  stay  late  after  
office
 
hours,
 
except
 
in
 
exceptional
 
circumstances
 
where
 
urgent
 
work
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
addressed.
 
 ATTENDANCE  SYSTEM  
All  employees  are  required  to  punch  in  and  out  using  the  attendance  system  (currently  
POROS)
 
to
 
accurately
 
record
 
their
 
daily
 
attendance
 
and
 
entry/exit
 
times.
 
Punctuality
 
is
 
a
 
fundamental
 
criterion
 
for
 
assessing
 
an
 
employee's
 
competence,
 
efficiency,
 
and
 
responsibility.
 
If  you  are  going  to  be  late  or  absent  due  to  illness  or  a  personal  matter,  it  is  essential  
to
 
inform
 
your
 
department
 
head
 
or
 
HR
 
before
 
your
 
scheduled
 
reporting
 
time.
 

 
 
Repeated  tardiness  or  absenteeism  may  be  considered  unsatisfactory  performance  
and
 
could
 
result
 
in
 
disciplinary
 
action.
 
 WORK  FROM  HOME  POLICY  
Associates  may  be  allowed  to  work  from  home  under  specific  scenarios,  provided  the  
following
 
conditions
 
are
 
met:
 
1.  Prior  Intimation :  Employees  must  inform  their  manager  in  advance,  presenting  
a
 
valid
 
reason
 
for
 
the
 
request
 
to
 
work
 
from
 
home.
 2.  Daily  Tasks :  A  clear  outline  of  tasks  to  be  completed  for  the  day  must  be  
provided.
 3.  Task  Submission :  At  the  end  of  the  day,  employees  are  required  to  submit  a  
report
 
of
 
completed
 
tasks.
 4.  Final  Approval :  The  manager  will  validate  the  work  completed  before  granting  
final
 
approval
 
for
 
the
 
work-from-home
 
arrangement.
 
This  policy  aims  to  maintain  productivity  while  offering  flexibility  in  the  work  
environment.
 
 WARNING  EMAIL  POLICY  
The  company's  policy  regarding  warnings  addresses  various  employee  issues,  
including
 
but
 
not
 
limited
 
to
 
punctuality,
 
performance,
 
behavior,
 
disciplinary
 
actions,
 
absconding,
 
and
 
data
 
theft.
 
This
 
policy
 
aims
 
to
 
establish
 
a
 
fair
 
and
 
transparent
 
process
 
for
 
addressing
 
concerns
 
before
 
resorting
 
to
 
strict
 
actions
 
or
 
legal
 
measures.
 
1.  Initial  Warning  (Warning  Mail  1) :  If  an  employee's  conduct  or  performance  is  
deemed
 
unsatisfactory
 
or
 
violates
 
company
 
policies,
 
they
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
Warning
 
Mail
 
1.
 
This
 
email
 
will
 
outline
 
the
 
issues
 
and
 
advise
 
the
 
employee
 
to
 
take
 
immediate
 
corrective
 
action.
 
The
 
employee
 
has
 
5
 
working
 
days
 
to
 
address
 
the
 
concerns
 
raised.
 2.  Second  Warning  (Warning  Mail  2) :  If  the  issues  are  not  resolved  within  the  
specified
 
timeframe,
 
a
 
second
 
warning
 
(Warning
 
Mail
 
2)
 
will
 
be
 
issued.
 
This
 
email
 
will
 
emphasize
 
the
 
seriousness
 
of
 
the
 
situation
 
and
 
the
 
potential
 
consequences
 
of
 
continued
 
non-compliance
 
or
 
poor
 
performance.
 

 
 
3.  Final  Warning  (Warning  Mail  3) :  Should  the  employee’s  performance  remain  
unsatisfactory
 
after
 
Warning
 
Mail
 
2,
 
a
 
third
 
and
 
final
 
warning
 
(Warning
 
Mail
 
3)
 
will
 
be
 
sent,
 
generally
 
7
 
days
 
after
 
the
 
second
 
warning.
 
This
 
email
 
will
 
clearly
 
state
 
that
 
it
 
is
 
the
 
last
 
opportunity
 
for
 
the
 
employee
 
to
 
rectify
 
the
 
situation.
 
Failure  to  improve  after  Warning  Mail  3  may  lead  to  serious  consequences,  including  
termination
 
of
 
employment
 
and
 
recovery
 
of
 
any
 
business
 
losses.
 
This  structured  approach  ensures  that  employees  are  given  fair  opportunities  to  
correct
 
their
 
behaviour
 
while
 
maintaining
 
the
 
integrity
 
and
 
standards
 
of
 
the
 
company.
 
 LEAVE  POLICY   
The  company  provides  all  employees  with  a  leave  package  of  12  leave  per  annum ,  
allocated
 
as
 
1
 
leave
 
per
 
month
.
 
Here
 
are
 
the
 
key
 
details
 
of
 
the
 
leave
 
policy:
 
●  Carry  Forward :  A  maximum  of  6  leaves  may  be  carried  forward  each  year,  based  
on
 
the
 
leave
 
balance
 
as
 
of
 
December
 
31st
.
 ●  Leave  Encashment :  Employees  may  encash  their  leave  balance,  ranging  from  6  
to
 
12
 
leaves
,
 
based
 
on
 
their
 
last
 
drawn
 
basic
 
salary.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
an
 
employee
 
has
 
15
 
leaves
 
as
 
of
 
December
 
31st:
 ○  6  leaves  will  be  carried  forward  to  the  next  year.  ○  6  leaves  can  be  encashed,  calculated  as  follows:  ■  If  the  basic  salary  is  Rs.  15,000  per  month  (Rs.  500  per  day),  the  
encashment
 
for
 
6
 
leaves
 
would
 
be
 
Rs.
 
3,000
.
 ○  The  remaining  3  leaves  (from  the  13th  to  the  15th)  will  lapse  without  
compensation
 
or
 
carry
 
forward.
 ●  Pre-Approval  for  Leave :  Leaves  (except  for  illness  and  sick  leave)  must  be  
pre-approved
 
at
 
least
 
7
 
days
 
prior
 
to
 
the
 
intended
 
absence.
 ●  Sick  Leave :  If  sick  leave  extends  beyond  two  days ,  a  doctor’s  certificate  is  
required.
 
This  policy  ensures  that  leave  is  managed  effectively  while  allowing  employees  to  
benefit
 
from
 
their
 
entitlements.
 

    
COMPENSATORY  LEAVE  POLICY   
Employees  may  be  eligible  for  Compensatory  Leave  under  the  following  conditions,  
which
 
must
 
be
 
pre-approved:
 
1.  Eligibility  Criteria:  ○  Employees  who  work  on  a  company  holiday  or  scheduled  week  off  to  
meet
 
company
 
or
 
client
 
requirements
 
are
 
eligible
 
for
 
Compensatory
 
Leave.
 ○  Employees  who  work  5  additional  hours  beyond  the  standard  45  hours  
per
 
week
 
or
 
5
 
extra
 
hours
 
in
 
a
 
single
 
day
 
(beyond
 
the
 
regular
 
9
 
hours)
 
will
 
also
 
qualify.
 2.  Leave  Credit:  ○  Compensatory  Leave  will  be  treated  as  one  of  the  leaves  added  to  the  
employee's
 
leave
 
credit
 
balance.
 3.  Clubbing  Rules:  ○  All  leave  types,  including  holidays  and  week  offs,  can  be  clubbed  with  
personal
 
leave.
 ○  Continuous  leave  of  5  days  cannot  be  taken,  except  for  sick  leave.  ○  Leaves  during  peak  seasons  are  not  permissible  unless  approved  by  
management.
 
This  policy  ensures  that  employees  are  fairly  compensated  for  extra  work  while  
maintaining
 
structured
 
leave
 
management.
 
 ABANDONMENT  OF  SERVICE  
Unauthorized  absence  from  work  can  lead  to  salary  deductions  and/or  disciplinary  
action.
 
Specifically,
 
if
 
an
 
associate
 
is
 
absent
 
without
 
approval
 
and
 
fails
 
to
 
inform
 
their
 
department
 
head
 
for
 
a
 
continuous
 
period
 
of
 
10
 
working
 
days
 
or
 
more
,
 
this
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
the
 
loss
 
of
 
job
 
lien
 
at
 
the
 
discretion
 
of
 
Management.
 
Consequently,
 
the
 
employee's
 
services
 
will
 
end
 
automatically
 
without
 
further
 
notice.
 
Additionally,  any  misbehaviour  or  non-compliance  with  the  company’s  code  of  
discipline
 
will
 
be
 
taken
 
seriously
 
and
 
may
 
result
 
in
 
immediate
 
termination
 
of
 
employment.
 

  
 PUBLIC  HOLIDAYS   The  company  observes  regular  public  holidays  each  year.  All  associates  will  be  
informed
 
of
 
the
 
public
 
holiday
 
schedule
 
at
 
the
 
beginning
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
For
 
reference,
 
the
 
holiday
 
list
 
for
 
the
 
current
 
year
 
is
 
available
 
through
 
the
 
Human
 
Resources
 
department.
  
PAYOUT  POLICY   The  cut-off  date  for  calculating  payouts  is  the  30th  of  every  month .  Once  the  system  is  
updated,
 
the
 
associate’s
 
pay
 
details
 
and
 
a
 
list
 
of
 
payments
 
along
 
with
 
any
 
deductions
 
will
 
be
 
forwarded
 
to
 
the
 
Accounts
 
department.
 
Salaries
 
will
 
be
 
credited
 
to
 
the
 
respective
 
company-nominated
 
employee
 
bank
 
accounts
 
by
 
the
 
5th
 
to
 
7th
 
of
 
each
 
month
 
at
 
the
 
earliest.
  
INCOME  TAX  POLICY  
Income  tax  will  be  deducted  in  accordance  with  the  Income  Tax  Act  and  Rules  
currently
 
in
 
effect.
 
Tax
 
deductions
 
will
 
be
 
made
 
monthly
 
(or
 
the
 
month
 
following
 
appraisals)
 
based
 
on
 
estimates
 
of
 
the
 
tax
 
payable
 
for
 
the
 
year,
 
which
 
typically
 
considers
 
the
 
assured
 
minimum
 
income.
 
Deductions  will  be  calculated  on  salaries,  professional  fees,  allowances,  and  any  
perquisites.
 
Associates
 
are
 
required
 
to
 
provide
 
accurate
 
details
 
of
 
their
 
tax
 
relief
 
investments,
 
as
 
this
 
information
 
will
 
be
 
essential
 
for
 
the
 
Tax
 
Deductible
 
at
 
Source
 
(TDS)
 
computation.
 
 
PERFORMANCE  APPRAISAL  POLICY   
The  performance  appraisal  process  aims  to  identify  star  performers  and  those  needing  
improvement
 
while
 
providing
 
valuable
 
feedback
 
on
 
job
 
performance,
 
behaviour,
 
and
 
personal
 
characteristics.
 
This
 
feedback
 
helps
 
employees
 
correct
 
errors,
 
enhance
 
their
 
performance,
 
and
 
grow
 
as
 
individuals.
 
 

 
 
Key  Features  of  the  Appraisal  System:  
1.  Collaborative  Goal  Setting :  ○  The  appraiser  and  appraisee  will  jointly  plan  targets,  scope  of  work,  and  
OKRs
 
(Objectives
 
and
 
Key
 
Results)
 
well
 
in
 
advance.
 
These
 
signed-off
 
objectives
 
form
 
the
 
foundation
 
of
 
the
 
appraisal
 
process.
 2.  Review  Frequency :  ○  Performance  will  be  reviewed  quarterly  and  annually,  allowing  for  regular  
feedback
 
and
 
adjustment.
 3.  Assistance  and  Bottleneck  Identification :  ○  The  process  will  identify  any  support  needed  to  achieve  targets  and  
address
 
potential
 
bottlenecks.
 4.  Training  and  Induction :  ○  HR  will  explain  the  detailed  appraisal  process  during  induction  and  
ongoing
 
training
 
sessions.
 5.  Focus  on  Development :  ○  The  appraisal  aims  not  only  to  assess  performance  but  also  to  emphasize  
personal
 
development.
 
It
 
recognizes
 
individual
 
efforts
 
and
 
rewards
 
them
 
accordingly.
 6.  Training  Needs  Assessment :  ○  Training  requirements  will  be  identified  based  on  the  outcomes  of  the  
performance
 
appraisal.
 
This  system  is  a  vital  management  tool  designed  to  foster  mutual  trust  and  
accountability
 
while
 
encouraging
 
professional
 
growth
 
and
 
development.

Our

learning.
 
Ultimately,
 
these
 
activities
 
aim
 
to
 
foster
 
both

company
 
growth.
 
Training  Phases  
1.  Induction  Phase :
